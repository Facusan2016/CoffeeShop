# BeanScene Frontend

## Description

This project was made in two different parts, the backend part is in the following [Link ](https://github.com/Facusan2016/CoffeeShopBackend). The main idea of this project is to learn and improve my skills using ReactJS framework including React-Redux and also making responsive websites being able to adapt the content to all screen sizes.

My inspiration was based on the following [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1201418433329014860) landing page, then I created the rest of the pages making a file apart also in Figma (you can find it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/m3S8TMIdLEnq0utfy2qnn7/Bean-Scene-Coffee-Landingpage-(Community)?t=0sVvK7M9SlQKJBty-0)) where I desgined and implemented an About us, Contact us, Shop, ShopPage, ShopCart pages.

I also used a RestApi that I found on the internet to get the coffee data, so if there're errors I would appreciate if you let me know, you can find the RestApi in this [Link](https://api.sampleapis.com/coffee/hot)

you can use the following codes to get a discount on the ShopCart page:
 
 - "beanscene", 10% discount
 - "coffee", 15% discount
 

Here are some technologies that I used:

- Axios
- Framer Motion
- Redux
- SweetAlert2
- React Router Dom V6
